            <h1>What is PriceWatch?</h1>
            <p>As time moves forward, the world of online shopping continues to grow with more and more people transitioning to the internet as their primary source of procuring their most wanted items. It‚Äôs much easier to click a few buttons and have a package go straight to your doorstep rather than physically traveling to a store to get it. At the same time however, businesses and companies have exploited this fact by deliberately increasing prices of popular items in an attempt to get more money than they usually would in-person. Prices that are marked on sale are likely to be the same regular retail price, and only a few people out of the masses can actually tell when they‚Äôre being scammed. </p>

            <p>We aim to address this problem by gathering the price of an item through multiple different storefronts and displaying the best price available to you. With PriceWatch, you will be able to input a supported item link you're interested in through the homepage search bar and we will display prices that are regularly updated through set intervals in real-time.</p>

            <br>

            <p>We guarantee you will click that checkout button with a smile!</p>
